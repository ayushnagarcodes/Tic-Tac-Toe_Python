# Tic-Tac-Toe Python
- This is my first project as a beginner in python. I tried to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game with all basic python code.
- I didn't use any complex code. I used basic string & input methods along with scopes, while loop & for loop to create this program.
- It works on 3x3 grid & coordinate system i.e, we have to input coordinates to make our move.
- Some of its key features is that it checks userinput for wrong input i.e, It will raise warning if we give 'two two' as an input or an input which is out of range eg., 1 4.
